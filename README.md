# Kanbas React Web App

A full-stack React web application that demonstrates modern web development practices using React.js, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## 📋 Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB. It implements best practices for modern web development and serves as a learning resource for full-stack development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (for backend functionality)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kanbas-react-web-app.git
   cd kanbas-react-web-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
